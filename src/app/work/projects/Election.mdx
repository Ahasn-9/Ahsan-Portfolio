### Check out the Pak Election 2024 Sentimental Analysis Case Study on behance.


## Overview

I developed a machine learning-based sentiment analysis system to evaluate public opinion on Pakistanâ€™s General Election using NLP techniques.
The project focused on collecting, processing, and classifying election-related social media data, along with constituency-based sentiment insights.

## Key Features

- **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Collected and cleaned large datasets of election-related social media posts.
- **Sentiment Classification**: Implemented ML models to categorize opinions as positive, negative, or neutral.
- **Constituency Analysis**: Built a module to track sentiment trends across different constituencies.
- **Visualization**: Displayed sentiment insights through graphical reports and charts for better understanding.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core language for development
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning model training and evaluation
- **NLTK / TextBlob**:Natural Language Processing libraries for text analysis
- **Pandas / NumPy**: Data preprocessing and manipulation
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**: Data visualization and result presentation


## My Role and Process

- **Research and Requirements**: Studied election-related data and defined project goals with clear constraints.
- **Tweets Scraping**: Collected election-related tweets using scraping techniques for dataset preparation.
- **Constituency Module**: Designed and implemented constituency-wise sentiment mapping.
- **Frontend Development**: Built a simple interface to display sentiment results and constituency-wise insights.

## Outcomes

- **Accuracy**: Achieved reliable sentiment classification performance using ML models.
- **Insights**: Delivered constituency-level sentiment reports, providing deeper election-related opinion trends.
- **Scalability**: Designed a system that can adapt to other social or political sentiment analysis tasks.

## Reflections

This project strengthened my skills in machine learning, NLP, and data analysis. I also gained experience in managing complex datasets, evaluating models, and building practical insights from raw data.
